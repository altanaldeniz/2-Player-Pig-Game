Welcome to the Pig Game.
This is a turn based game, each player has 2 available actions. Either hold or roll (dice).
Roll button rolls a dice between 1 and 6. If the rolled number is not 1, player gains points equal to dice number and continues their turn. If the rolled number is 1, player loses all their not stored points and their turn.
Hold button simply stores all of your points and ends your turn. You can't hold when you have 0 points.
First player to get 50 points wins the game. Good luck.
